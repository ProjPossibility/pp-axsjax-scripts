This email is intended only for those working on AxsJax (Prashanth and
myself).


Notes from conversation with Charles Chen on AxsJax:

Wikipedia--we do two primary things:
1. Search for article
2. Read that article

We really want the user to have consistent look, feel, and behavior to
the page as has been done for other Google applications already (for
example, try using google search with AxsJax):

'/' = primary search blank
'?' = list all the current commands
p = previous item
n = next item
g = guided search
...and more.

Notice one of two things happens when searching on Wikipedia:
1) The search results appears (we can use n/p to go through search results)
2) Article returns -- go to article reading mode

Idea: Create an ordered array of paragraphs, and headings, etc which we
can traverse, perhaps using guided mode (test this on google search, and
hit 'g')

When a paragraph has focus, have a key that tells you: "This paragraph
has x links and x citations.  Also have a key that allows you to cycle
through each link in the paragraph.

Paragraphs should be read through without mentioning each link in
them--most of the links are trivial and redundant and annoying for the
screen reader to read.

Advanced features to come back to AFTER this is all over: If we want to
discuss, edit, examine the history of the page (hasn't given it too much
thought at this point) --- this is not within the scope of the competition

MySpace: A little more open ended.  Make it accessible in the same
"style" as other AxsJax applications.

Features
1) Kill switch on flash players by removing it from the page entirely.
Global block flash (remove any flash from the page) -- Kind of like an
ad blocking greasemonkey script
2) Quick jump to comment area, blog area, different areas of the profile
3) Cycle through of all the friends
4) Quick cycle through comments
5) Editing comments
