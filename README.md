Overview

Please be sure to visit the Google AxsJAX homepage for all the details about the AxsJAX project, how it works, and how to make use of AxsJAX scripts.

What is AxsJAX? From the AxsJAX Home Page: AJAX techniques have helped Web developers create live applications within Web browsers. The AxsJAX framework helps inject accessibility features into these applications so that users of adaptive technologies such as screen readers and self-voicing browsers experience the same level of interactivity that is now taken for granted by users of Web 2.0 applications.

Project:Possibility is authoring a growing collection of AxsJAX scripts which will inject accessibility features into websites which did not previously exist. Currently, we have created scripts for Facebook, Wikipedia and Web Sudoku
